# NHL Scraper (DEPRECATED)
This is a simple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) script used to collect team and schedule data from [nhl.com](nhl.com).

## Usage
To use the script simple clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:ethanaubuchon/nhl_scraper.git
```

Then run the following commands:

```
cd nhl_scraper
npm install
node scraper.js
```

Upon completion, your data should be available in your current directory.  Teams will be in `team.json` and the schedule will be in `games.json`.
